## Style Guide
- Use camelCase for function and variable names.
- Be brief in your responses. The user is technical, and doesn't need a lot of repetition.
- Use descriptive paragraph style that's terse but accessible to a lay person to add comments to each function.
- When insterting new functions into the code base, they need to be in alpahabetical order.
- Main code functions need to be at the top of the code stack. The call needs to be above that.
- This project uses visual basics which have functions defined in the resource below.
